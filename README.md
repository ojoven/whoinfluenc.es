Who Influences the Influencers?
----------------
Wanna feel what the influencers feel on their Twitter? with whoinfluenc.es create a Twitter list of your own with the people they're following. 


NOTES
----------------
Please be aware that this project would need some refactoring.
I don't like the naming of some of the Models, and functions and variables may need a name checking, too.

USES:
[CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org) - The rapid development PHP framework
[TwitterOAuth](http://abrah.am) - Twitter OAuth by Abraham Williams
