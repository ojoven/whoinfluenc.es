About
----------------
WhoInfluenc.es is a weekend project made by [@ojoven](http://twitter.com/ojoven) where Twitter users can create Twitter lists with the followings of a certain user.

How is this useful? 
--------------------
Well, by generating Twitter lists of the followings / influencers of a certain user, you can get to know much more what that user is interested in. Who he/she follows and what he/she reads.

Notes
----------------
Please be aware that this project would need some refactoring.
I don't like the naming of some of the Models, and functions and variables may need a name checking, too.

Roadmap
---------------
The truth is that I don't see much more to be added to this project. If you have any idea, anyway, don't hesitate to fork and make a pull request or to send me an email [you'll find it on my GitHub profile] or to mention me on Twitter.

Some ideas, anyway:
* To set a cron that updates the lists from time to time
* If at anytime Twitter updates its API on adding users to list, revise the brute force strategy being used now.
